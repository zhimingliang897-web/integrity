Good afternoon.
Good afternoon. How can I help you?

I’d like to buy some medicine.
Sure. What’s it for?

I have a small skin problem. It’s a bit red and itchy.
I see. Do you know the name of the medicine?

Not exactly. I only remember part of it—maybe “roxi”… or “luo-hong”.
Do you mean roxithromycin?

Yes, that sounds right.
Okay. It usually comes as an ointment. One moment.

Here you are—roxithromycin ointment.
Great. How do I use it?

Apply a thin layer two to three times a day. Keep the area clean.
Got it. I’ll take it. Thank you.

You’re welcome. Take care.
