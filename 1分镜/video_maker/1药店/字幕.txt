Customer: Good afternoon.
Clerk: Good afternoon. How can I help you?

Customer: I’d like to buy some medicine.
Clerk: Sure. What’s it for?

Customer: I have a small skin problem. It’s a bit red and itchy.
Clerk: I see. Do you know the name of the medicine?

Customer: Not exactly. I only remember part of it—maybe “roxi”… or “luo-hong”.
Clerk: Do you mean roxithromycin?

Customer: Yes, that sounds right.
Clerk: Okay. It usually comes as an ointment. One moment.

Clerk: Here you are—roxithromycin ointment.
Customer: Great. How do I use it?

Clerk: Apply a thin layer two to three times a day. Keep the area clean.
Customer: Got it. I’ll take it. Thank you.

Clerk: You’re welcome. Take care.
