It was a busy morning on the MRT.
The train was moving fast, and people were standing quietly, lost in their own thoughts.

Suddenly, I felt strange.
My head grew light, and my hands turned cold.
I tried to stay calm, but it was no use.

I sat down and curled up on the seat.
For a moment, I closed my eyes and took a deep breath.

A stranger noticed me.
He came closer and spoke in a soft voice.

“Are you all right?” he asked.

“No,” I replied.
“I feel dizzy. I think my blood sugar is low.”

“Have you eaten today?” he asked.

“Not much,” I said.
“I skipped breakfast.”

He looked worried.
Without saying much, he took out some candy and handed it to me.

“Here,” he said.

I took it slowly.
My hands were shaking, but I tried to breathe steadily.

“Sit still,” he said.
“Take your time.”

After a few minutes, I began to feel better.

“Thank you,” I said quietly.

“If you feel worse, we can get off at the next station,” he said.
“The staff will be able to help.”

I nodded.
I was still weak, but I was no longer alone.
